HowMuchToPay
============

How Much To Pay is an Android App to calculate total amount to pay for investment needed including fee. This is my first attempt to write useable app (at least useful for me).

The formula used is: (amount * 100)/(100 - fee)


How To Use
==========

1. Enter __Amount__ (value only),
2. Enter __Fee__ (in percentage, value only),
3. Click __Calculate__ button to process.
