HowMuchToPay
============

How Much To Pay is an Android App to calculate total amount to pay for investment needed including fee. 
Example: You want to invest $1000 to your investment institution, however, the institution is getting fee based on your investment, let say 1.1% of it. Of course, if you just pay $1000, minusing 1.1% of fee, your final investment will be lower than $1000 already. This app is used to calculate final investment amount plus the fee, so you invest what amount you want to invest.
