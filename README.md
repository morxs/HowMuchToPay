HowMuchToPay
============

How Much To Pay is an Android App to calculate total amount to pay for investment needed including fee. This is my first attempt to write useable app (at least useful for me).


Formula
=======

The formula used is: (amount * 100)/(100 - fee)


How To Use
==========

1. Enter *Amount* (value only),
2. Enter *Fee* (in percentage, value only),
3. Click *Calculate* button to process.
